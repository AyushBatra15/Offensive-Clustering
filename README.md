# Offensive-Clustering
Clustering NBA offenses based on shot selection, scoring splits, playing pace, passing, and more. 

In this project, I used K-means clustering to classify NBA offenses into 3 groups: Drived-Based offenses, Ball Movement offenses, and Self Creation offenses. I also analyzed some of the trends occurring in the recent seasons with these clusters.
